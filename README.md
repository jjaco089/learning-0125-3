# Learining inheritance in Java
- Consider a program handling a database.
- Initially, we are tracking only movies. Later we decide to add TV shows and music albums too. 
- Create Movie class first. Then create superclass Item because movies, tv shows, and music albums are all items in our database i.e. they are all subclasses of Item.
